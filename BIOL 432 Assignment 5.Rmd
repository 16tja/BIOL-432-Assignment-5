```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##  **Part 1**

The first step in this assignment will be to load the necessary packages.

```{r}
library(rentrez)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```
Next, we will create a new Github repository called "Rentrez" and link this assignment's R project folder to it. This done outside of the R markdown file.

Now we will add a new script called "Download.R" where we will continue working through part 1 of this assignment.
